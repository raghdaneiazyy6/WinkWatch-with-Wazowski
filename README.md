# ***WinkWatch-with-Wazowski***


## Introduction

WinkWatch with Wazowski is a delightful UI and **Qt application** that leverages real EEG, we delve into the world of signal processing to refine raw data, removing noise and enhancing its quality. With machine learning models at its core, the application seamlessly classifies the user's ongoing EEG signals to determine if the user's eye state is open or closed. 

Inspired by Mike Wazowski from Monsters Inc., this project combines cutting-edge technology with a touch of whimsy. With a user-friendly interface, it provides real-time feedback on eye states, opening up exciting possibilities for interactive applications. Join us in exploring the fascinating world of brain-computer interfaces with a touch of Pixar magic!
